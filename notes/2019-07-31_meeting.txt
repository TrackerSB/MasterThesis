- Interface
    - AI
        - Use client
        - start(sid, vid)
        - getControl(...)  # FIXME needed?
        - stop(sid)
        - NOT allowed to SUCCESS or FAILURE a test
    - Test generator
        - Do NOT use client
        - getTest()
            - Returns XML => start simulation
            - Returns None => Generation finished
        - start()
        - fail(errormessage/trace)
        - trace == list of DataResponse
        - stop(sid)
        - Error interface? (Tell the generator that XML was invalid)  # FIXME needed?
        - Allow to CANCEL simulations
- Required for manageging the challenge
    - Test management
        - Setup test generation
        - Call test generation
        - Setup AIs for all spawned vehicles
        - Fixed snippets for failure (damage and offroad)
        - Insert content of failure tag
        - Compare with BeamNG AI
            - getTest() --> XML
            - Duplicate XML
            - Replace AUTONOMOUS with TRAINING
            - FIXME Should do it?
        - Detect whether an AI or a test generator forced SUCCESS/FAILURE of a test
        - After a test finished: Pass collected data to test generator
        - Check for new data (FIXME Introduce timestamps?)
    - Challenge evaluation
        - Test generator
            - Number of unique failure
                - damage vs offroad
                - same position?
                - same speed/direction or velocity vector?
                - introduce tolerances
            - Number of tests
            - Average time of generating tests
- Conventions
    - Test generation
        - Autonomous car name: ego
        - Restricted to ONE autonomous car
        - Empty failure tag
