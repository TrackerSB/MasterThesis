 - If chapter too long --> Appendix (like library/version table)
 - Link implementation to method section
 - Not more implementation details
 - Able to replicate the work based on implementation section
 - Implementation section is enough
 - Maybe mention shortly LUA triggers (one sentence)
 - High level description in prefab, json and lua
 - Logically obstacles is a static object --> Use APIs by BeamNG (No need to explain HOW objects are included)
 - Semantic model move to method section (maybe separate subsection)
 - B-Spline --> Design decision (Mention its not invented; pretty common)
 - If change language, does decision change? If so, then implementation, else method section.
 - Table caption above; figure caption below
 - Maybe instead of implementation use high level and low level description
 - Do not explain how protobuf accesses/changes properties (If really important show example)
 - Mention usage of client
 - Example for DataRequest and DataResponse (brief)
 - Messages everywhere masked except for client at DataRequest and DataResponse

Evaluation:
 - Reformulate description to others (Example of good practise "start(sid, vid)")
 - Experience is part of the evaluation
 - Talk to people, failures, implementation, test generation/construct AI
 - Make students submit tasks and implement client scheme
 - Address their needs (wheather, CarToLaneAngle, Restart,...)
 - Plan it in a way that it does not explode
 - Imagine: Which contributions, why contributions, research questions
 - Technical evaluation: Requirement coverage, efficiency, scalability, accuracy of system (e.g. two more than one experience my own generator but also other generators.
    Do they cover other features?
    Is this the case.
 - Coverage table: Features offered: Find features used
 - Evaluate two AIs
 - How supportive is DriveBuild?
 - Some sort of performance measurements like how long run tests, is the system scalable
 - => Show properties of systems (System crashed, tests failed because of system)
 - => Less important than other experience
 - Not sure whether worth of formal user study
 - Maybe informal interview (Useful/Not useful)
