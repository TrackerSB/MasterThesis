Title:
DriveBuild: Automation of Simulation-based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles

Abstract:
The most common technique for testing autonomous vehicles (AVs) is simulation based testing.
For each test testers need to describe a scenario, specify test criteria, setup a simulator, execute the test, connect artificial intelligences (AIs) to it and collect its results or generated training data.
This process is tedious and error prone.
I present DriveBuild, a research toolkit for simulation based testing of AVs.
DriveBuild comes with an abstract scheme for describing tests and provides a scalable client-server-architecture which offers a micro service based interface.
It also offers many metrics to provide to generators and AIs and to analyze them.
DriveBuild automates the process of setting up simulators, distributing test runs across a cluster, frequently checking test criteria during a simulation and summarizing test results.
Further it reduces the amount of time needed to invest into preparing, running and evaluating simulation based tests.
