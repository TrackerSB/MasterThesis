    The most common technique for testing \glspl{av} is simulation based testing.
    For each test testers need to describe a scenario, specify test criteria, setup a simulator, execute the test and collect its results.
    This process is tedious and error prone.
    I present \drivebuild{}, a research toolkit for simulation based testing of \glspl{av}.
    \drivebuild{} automates the process of setting up simulators, checking test criteria at simulation time, summarizing test results and distributing test runs across a cluster.
    \drivebuild{} reduces the amount of time needed to invest into preparing, running and evaluating simulation based tests.
    In this thesis I will additionally investigate how \drivebuild{} can be used concerning topics of test generation and training \glspl{av}.
