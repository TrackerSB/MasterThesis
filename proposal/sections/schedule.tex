The thesis is limited to a maximum time period of 6 months.
Starting at the 13th of May this results in 26 weeks ending on 10th of November.
Since \drivebuild{} is used during the seminar the schedule has to consider the progress of the seminar and requires to result in a working implementation until half of the semester.
The schedule in \autoref{table:schedule} divides into three milestones.
The first milestone contains the collection of requirements and the actual implementation of \drivebuild{}.
In the second milestone I will collect data about the executed tests, conduct my qualitative study and evaluate my work.
In the third milestone I will write the actual thesis.
